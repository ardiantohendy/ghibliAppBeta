# ghibliAppBeta
This is an application that I created using data from "https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/" with an API. The purpose of making this application is to improve my understanding of API. You can try to download this application by downloading the apk named "ghibli App Beta.apk". In the future maybe I will add some additional features, both in terms of function and appearance. Thank you.
